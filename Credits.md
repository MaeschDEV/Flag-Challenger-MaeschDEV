Hello everyone!
Here is a list of all the assets I have used in this app.

* All flags in the app are from the large flag library of:
* * [Welt Flaggen](https://www.welt-flaggen.de/) (German website)'
* * [Flagpedia](https://flagpedia.net/) (English website)'
* The app was made possible thanks to Flutter.
* Some icons are from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* The icon named Auction is an icon from the website [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) and the author is *Freepik*
* The icon named privacy-policy is an icon from the website [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) and the author is *sonnycandra*
* The icon named theme is an icon from the website [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) and the author is *Ian Anandara*
* The Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use texts have been generated by the website [App Privacy Policy Generator.nisrulz](https://app-privacy-policy-generator.nisrulz.com/)
* The settings page design was based on the design of the Android app 'Tip Calculator' from 'Flatiron Apps'.
* Coded and designed by me, MaeschDEV.

**Many thanks to everyone who made this project possible!**
